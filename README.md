# Database-Security
Nowadays, many applications require sensitive information about their users to work properly.
Users want to be sure that their data cannot be stolen or leaked and it is the job of the
programmer to ensure that their data is stored securely


# Objectives
__1. Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
via 2-way encryption);__
__2. Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
common data and the decrypted sensitive data);__
__3. Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
secure).__
